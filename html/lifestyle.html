          <h2>Ahara- Diet and dietary regimen: </h2>
          <p>An inappropriate and unbalanced diet is the main reason behind the lifestyle disorders in the body. The ample growth and maintenance of the body mostly depend on an optimum and balanced diet. There is a long list of wholesome diet illustrated in Ayurveda. Ayurveda describes the method of preparation, code, and the discipline of taking a wholesome diet. The selection of the diet of an individual as per bodily constitution is important to maintain optimum health. The diet should be simple, easily digestible, and optimum in quantity. Overeating and consumption of unbalanced diets / tamasa and rajas diets should be avoided because these diets can cause excess overload on the digestion system and metabolic process of the body.</p>
